# simple-react-bulma

Simple bulma components in React.

Bulma is easily consumable by React application without any additional wrappers. But in several cases it is not the case.  For example, dropdown component is quite difficult to work with.

This library provides support for these difficult use cases.

It is written in TypeScript.
